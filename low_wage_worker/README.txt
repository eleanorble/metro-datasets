Note:  We used ACS, 5-year, 2012-2016 microdata to create clusters of low-wage workers
in order to compare the unique circumstances of various population subsets at the national, state, 
and metropolitan levels.Definitions:
'Universe population' is the total civilian, non-institutionalized population 18-64
'Workers' is a subset of the universe population, defined as follows: 
- Currently in the labor force (employed or unemployed)
- Worked at some point in the last year

We then exclude a number of populations: 
- Anyone enrolled in school who worked fewer than 14 weeks over the previous year 
- Anyone enrolled and living in group quarters
- Anyone enrolled in high school and living with a parent
- Anyone enrolled in graduate school
- People who report earning any self-employment income over the previous year or who report working in their own business
- People who report their primary job is unpaid in a family business or farm
- Those who report working more than 98 hours per week
- Those who earn wages below $.94 per hour or more than $187.38 per hour

'Mid/high-wage workers' is a subset of the worker population who earn above the hourly wage threshold we set
'Low-wage workers' is a subset of the worker population who earn above the hourly wage threshold we set

'Clusters' are low-wage workers divided into 9 groups based on age, education, and enrollment status. There are 9 total clusters. 
Those clusters are defined as follows: 
(1) 18-24 year olds, some college experience or less, not enrolled in school 
(2) 18-24 year olds, some college experience or less, enrolled in school 
(3) 18-24 year olds, associate degree or more, enrolled and not enrolled 
(4) 25-50 year olds, high school diploma or less 
(5) 25-50 year olds, some college experience, but no post-secondary degree 
(6) 25-50 year olds, associate degree or more 
(7) 51-64 year olds, high school diploma or less 
(8) 51-64 year olds, some college experience, but no post-secondary degree 
(9) 51-64 year olds, associate degree or more
